## Customizing Limits

The application is designed for speed and efficiency. You can adjust various limits based on your needs:

### Company Search Limits

- Location: `scraper/services.py` (lines 865-890)

```python
# Current settings (optimized for speed):
companies_house_results = self.companies_house_scraper.search_company(company_name, max_results=15)
linkedin_results = self.linkedin_scraper.search_company(company_name, max_results=10)
google_results = self.google_scraper.search_company(company_name, max_results=10)
crunchbase_results = self.crunchbase_scraper.search_company(company_name, max_results=5)
dandb_results = self.dandb_scraper.search_company(company_name, max_results=10)
```

- To increase results: Change the `max_results` values (e.g., from 10 to 25)

### Total Results Limit

- Location: `scraper/views.py` (line 472)

```python
# Current setting:
consolidated_data = service.get_consolidated_company_data(company_name, max_results=50)
```

- To change: Modify the `max_results=50` value

### Director Limits

- Location: `scraper/services.py` (line 940)

```python
# Current setting:
limited_directors = active_directors[:3]  # Only first 3 directors per company
```

- To change: Modify the slice `[:3]` to `[:5]` for 5 directors, or `[:10]` for 10 directors

### Contact Generation Limits

- Location: `scraper/services.py` (lines 1046-1080)

```python
# Company contacts - currently generates 2 contacts (email + LinkedIn)
# Director contacts - currently generates 1 contact (email only)
```

- To add more contacts: Uncomment or add additional contact types in the contact generation functions

## Configuration Options

### Database Configuration

The application uses SQLite by default. For production, consider using PostgreSQL:

```python
# In settings.py
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'your_db_name',
        'USER': 'your_db_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

## Data Sources

The application scrapes data from:

1. Companies House - Official UK company registry
2. LinkedIn - Professional networking platform
3. Google Search - Web search results
4. Crunchbase - Business information platform
5. Dun & Bradstreet - Business data provider

## Important Notes

- Rate Limiting: Be mindful of the scraping limits to avoid being blocked by data sources
- Data Accuracy: Contact information is estimated and may not be 100% accurate
- Legal Compliance: Ensure you comply with the terms of service of data sources
- Performance: Higher limits will result in slower scraping times

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Import Errors: Make sure your virtual environment is activated
2. Database Errors: Run `python manage.py migrate` to set up the database
3. Scraping Failures: Check your internet connection and the target websites' availability
4. Memory Issues: Reduce the search limits if you encounter memory problems
